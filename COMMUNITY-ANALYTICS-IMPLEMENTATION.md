## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/analytics/communities
- ?timeRange=7d|30d|90d (time period filter)
- ?communityId=<id> (individual community analytics)
```

### Database Queries (Prisma)
```typescript
// Core tables used:
- Communities (community data)
- CommunityConnections (member relationships)
- Events (event information)
- EventLink (community-event relationships)
- EventParticipants (RSVP/attendance data)
- CommunityReferrals (referral tracking)
```

### Components Structure
```
components/dashboard/communities/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enhanced-communities-overview.tsx    # Overview dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enhanced-community-details.tsx       # Individual community analytics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ communities-overview.tsx             # Original overview (fallback)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ community-details.tsx                # Original details (fallback)
```

## üìä Data Sources & Reliability

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Data Sources (Prisma Database)
- **Communities Table**: 737-line schema with comprehensive community data
- **CommunityConnections**: Member join dates, status tracking
- **Events & EventLink**: Event creation and community associations
- **EventParticipants**: RSVP and attendance status
- **CommunityReferrals**: Referral success tracking

### üîÑ Growth Calculation Formula
```typescript
growthScore = (newMembers √ó 0.7) + (newEvents √ó 100)
```

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Visual Components
- **Data Source Indicators**: Clear labeling of confirmed viable data
- **Time Range Selectors**: 7d, 30d, 90d filtering options
- **Interactive Charts**: Area charts, pie charts, progress bars
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading with spinner indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with retry options
- **Numerical Change Display**: Shows actual numerical changes instead of percentages
- **Dynamic Time Period Labels**: Compares against previous period of same duration

### Design System
- **Dark Theme**: Neutral-900 backgrounds with colored accents
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green (#10b981): Growth/Success metrics
  - Blue (#3b82f6): General analytics
  - Purple (#8b5cf6): Engagement metrics
  - Red (#ef4444): Churn/Negative metrics
  - Yellow (#eab308): Warning/Attention metrics

## üìà Analytics Calculations

### Member Segmentation Logic
```typescript
// New Members: Joined in last 30 days
newMembers = joinDate >= (now - 30 days) && status = 'ACCEPTED'

// Active Members: Updated in last 7 days  
activeMembers = updatedAt >= (now - 7 days) && status = 'ACCEPTED'

// Event Participants: Members who participated in community events
eventParticipants = members with EventParticipants records

// Dormant Members: No activity in 30+ days
dormantMembers = updatedAt < (now - 30 days) && status = 'ACCEPTED'
```

### Retention Analysis
```typescript
// 7-Day Retention
day7Cohort = members who joined 7+ days ago
day7Retained = cohort members still active in last 7 days
day7Retention = (day7Retained / day7Cohort) √ó 100

// 30-Day Retention  
day30Cohort = members who joined 30+ days ago
day30Retained = cohort members still active in last 30 days
day30Retention = (day30Retained / day30Cohort) √ó 100
```

### Event Analytics
```typescript
attendanceRate = (totalAttending / totalRSVPs) √ó 100
averageRSVPsPerEvent = totalRSVPs / totalEvents
```
