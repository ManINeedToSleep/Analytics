## 🔍 Definitions: Active

* **Core Actions:** Log in, visit space, post/comment/react, RSVP/attend event, message, invite
* **Light Engagement:** Link click, thread browse, profile view

**Track both:**

* **Light Active** = visited or browsed
* **Engaged Active** = posted, RSVP’d, messaged

> This helps separate passive users from participatory ones.
